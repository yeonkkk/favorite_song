      All the colors and personalities<br>
      you can’t see right through what I truly am<br>
      you’re hurting me without noticing<br>
      I’m so, so broke like someone just robbed me<br>
      <br>
      I’m no invincible<br>
      I have much memories of getting more weaker<br>
      I know I’m not loveable<br>
      but you know what you’d have to say<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      “Come on let’s go to bed<br>
      we gonna rock the night away<br>
      who did that to you, babe<br>
      If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then,<br>
      Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day<br>
      would you want me in bae<br>
      If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      come take my arms and go<br>
      I’II be yours for sure”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      All the traces and reminiscences<br>
      You can’t sense right through how I truly was<br>
      You were gripping me without noticing<br>
      Was so, so strange like Someone never loved me<br>
      <br>
      I’m no invincible<br>
      I have much memories of getting more weaker<br>
      I know I’m not loveable<br>
      but you know what you’d have to say<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      “Come on let’s go to bed<br>
      we gonna rock the night away!<br>
      who did that to you, babe<br>
      If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then,<br>
      Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day<br>
      would you want me in bae<br>
      If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
      come take my arms and go<br>
      I’ll be yours for sure”<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      You’re the only one, who saw my yesterday<br>
      the one who knows I’m here alive today<br>
      Comfort me say, what I’m meant to you<br>
      you should know what you have to say<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      “Come on let’s go to bed<br>
      we gonna rock the night away<br>
      who did that to you, babe<br>
      If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then,<br>
      Come on, let’s drink and have very unmanageable day<br>

      If you’re not in the right mood to sleep now then<br>
