    He's strong<br>
    Not one to settle down<br>
    You know he's that guy<br>
    Electric<br>
    Those lips can wear me out<br>
    Wild thing, he's all mine<br>
    It's crazy, but when he can't sleep, I understand<br>
    Like pressure points, my love can ease him in my hand, 'cause<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    (I got everything he needs)<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    (I got everything he needs)<br>
    Soft rain (soft rain)<br>
    We roll the windows down<br>
    Sweat disco all night<br>
    It's clear (it's clear)<br>
    We'd like to fool around<br>
    His hands reach for mine<br>
    I know it's tough, baby, keep both eyes on the road<br>
    Pull right, a burnt-out streetlight, only halfway home<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    (I got everything he needs)<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    (I got everything he needs)<br>
    Can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love, enough of my love<br>
    Enough of my–<br>
    I can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    Can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love, enough of my love<br>
    Enough of my–<br>
    I can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love (He needs me)<br>
    You know, not just physically<br>
    Emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, sexually<br>
    All the ways<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    (I got everything he needs)<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    He needs me, he needs me<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    (I got everything he needs)<br>
    Can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love, enough of my love<br>
    Enough of my–<br>
    I can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
    Can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love, enough of my love<br>
    Enough of my–<br>
    I can never give him enough<br>
    Enough of my love<br>
    (He needs me)<br>
