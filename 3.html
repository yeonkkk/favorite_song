      I wanna follow where she goes<br>
      I think about her and she knows it<br>
      I wanna let her take control<br>
      'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah<br>
      She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (mmm)<br>
      And maybe I should stop and start confessing<br>
      Confessing, yeah<br>
      Oh, I've been shaking<br>
      I love it when you go crazy<br>
      You take all my inhibitions<br>
      Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      You take me places that tear up my reputation<br>
      Manipulate my decisions<br>
      Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      There's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      There's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      She says that she's never afraid<br>
      Just picture everybody naked<br>
      She really doesn't like to wait<br>
      Not really into hesitation<br>
      Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa<br>
      And maybe I should stop and start confessing<br>
      Confessing, yeah<br>
      Oh, I've been shaking<br>
      I love it when you go crazy<br>
      You take all my inhibitions<br>
      Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      You take me places that tear up my reputation<br>
      Manipulate my decisions<br>
      Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      There's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far<br>
      I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright<br>
      If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark<br>
      I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright<br>
      'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far<br>
      I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright<br>
      If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark<br>
      I know we'd be alright, we would be alright<br>
      Oh, I've been shaking<br>

      You take me places that tear up my reputation<br>
      Manipulate my decisions<br>
      Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back (oh whoa)<br>
      There's nothing holdin' me back<br>
      I feel so free when you're with me, baby<br>
      Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back<br>
